# Jio-FaceBook Deal : Is Facebook going for Good? Debt Free RLJIO?


On 22nd April 2020, Facebook One of the most used social media platform announced a $5.7 billion deal with the Indian multinational conglomerate Reliance Industries to purchase approximately 10 percent of Jio Platforms, Reliance's digital media and services entity. This will also make facebook the largest minority shareholder in Reliance Industries Limited. It has been marked the biggest FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in telecom sector in recent times. 

The focus of their combined might is India Retail Sector, A difficult landscape as large parts of it are still not well coordinated. In recent years, the retail space has been an ongoing battlefield for behemoths such as Amazon and Walmart, themselves globally dominant players. The other interested parties in this are payment services companies such as the Softbank- and Alibaba-backed Paytm, and Google, which runs Google Pay. But the combination of facebook and reliance jio will be difficult to beat.


#  Debt Free Jio?

The investment, which values Jio Platforms at around $66 billion, will help Reliance Industries cut its spiraling debt pile. The deal, coming as it does at a time when the world is fighting the coronavirus pandemic, is a thumbs up to India’s potential.

Analysts at Credit Suisse say the deal follows the restructuring announced by RIL in October 2019, when the company transferred Rs 1,080 billion of debt from RJio to a standalone entity, leaving liabilities of around Rs 640 billion (spectrum liabilities and capex creditors) at Jio.

“The deal will aid in achieving net debt free by March 2021. As of December 31, 2019, the net debt for the group stood at Rs 1,531 billion and with Facebook's investment, this should put RIL on course to be net debt free by March 2021,” analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note.


#  Profit’s coming up for Facebook?


Facebook is looking to get a stronger foothold in the Indian telecom market. India may be already the biggest market for facebook as it holds 260 million Fb users, 400 million whatsApp  users and 80 million Instagram users. (Yes you heard it right). The US population today at the start of 2020 numbers just over 331 million people. One of the key point is to acquire Jio’s Subscriber base of nearly 400 million users. Why? 

Let’s take an instance of Facebook’s under development  short form video app Lasso. The moment it launches its app on Jio platform, it can look to dominate Tiktok (Chinese app that is immensely popular in India.) Moreover it can also generate some revenue from advertisements, data collections and other various forms. 


# Conclusion ? 

So, what then is the Jio-Facebook deal all about? Putting it simply, it is about one of the most successful Silicon Valley enterprises investing in India’s large, rapidly growing and attractive digital market. It is a decision based on the opportunity available to Facebook in what will eventually be its largest and most lucrative ecosystem. The decision also reflects Facebook’s belief, as the investor of $5.7 billion, in Reliance’s proven ability to scale and manage operations that compete globally across sectors. This explains why Facebook has chosen to be a minority partner while contributing substantially to developing a new business model.  These are the people who tirelessly propagate the fiction that the ‘India Story’ lacks potential and credibility. 

They believe that the post-COVID19 world will not only see India’s rise halted and its economy in a shambles, but also its new leadership and energy decimated. Facebook’s $5.7 billion minority stake in India’s largest technology ecosystem shows their belief to be what it is: a lurid illusion.

We began with what the Jio-Facebook agreement is not about. It would be in order to conclude with what it is essentially about. The investment tells the world that the future belongs to India and that future is digital.
